[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)is my note taking app, Task Manager and [[Obsidian as a Read Later App|Read Later]] App. Before I used [org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com/) and [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net). I dropped both because of the lacking mobile support. While org mode doesn't really have a feature equivalent app on Android. Syncthing has an official app, but it's very slow sadly and when you turned off your screen for a short time, the app closed completely. This was especially annoying when your shopping list is in Syncthing and every time you want to look up an item, you need to wait 30 seconds to get back to that file. 

Obsidian solved these issues for me and while I used it, I learned to love it's plugin ecosystem. The costumizability reminds me of my favorite code editors [Vim](https://www.vim.org) and [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). Because I always try to solve as many problems as possible with as few apps as need I nowadays also use it as a Task Manager with the help of [Tasks](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Introduction) and a read later app with the help of Bases and Obsidian Webclipper. Check out [[Obsidian as a Read Later App|my post]] on that topic, which goes into how it works in detail. I'm also trying to make Obsidian my calendar, but this didn't work out completely so far. Once I should solve that problem, I will give you an update here.
