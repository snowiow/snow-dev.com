Hi, my name is Marcel and I'm a Platform Engineer. My current interests are FinOps, [AWS](tags/AWS), [Emacs](/tags/emacs), [Obsidian](tags/obisidian) and all things [Linux](tags/linux). Probably you will find something about these topics here.

I want to experiment with a digital garden instead of a classic blog, because I began to use Obsidian for my private notes and I really like how different notes build interconnections over time. So I was looking for something similar on my public space. I ended up using  [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). I will probably also write in more detail how I exactly set it up at some point and will link it here.

This page will contain notes about things, little bits and longer [posts](/posts). You can also find the posts from my [old blog](https://blog.snow-dev.com) here as well.
